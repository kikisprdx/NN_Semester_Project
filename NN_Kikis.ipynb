    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to develop a 9-class classifier that can accurately identify Japanese male speakers based on short spectral recordings of their vowel utterances. \n",
    "\n",
    "The task involves training the classifier using a dataset of 12-channel time series data representing vocal samples, and then evaluating its performance on a separate test set to hopefully have achieved the lowest possible misclassification rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data overview :\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of 270 training and 370 test recordings of 12-channel time series data representing spectral recordings of the Japanese vowel /ae/ uttered by 9 male speakers, with each recording varying in length from 7 to 29 timesteps.\n"
